-- Two-contributor flags (PRD sections 4 and 8; audit finding 9; issue #911).
--
-- A signed-in member files at most one active flag per project, with
-- evidence. The second distinct active reporter pauses the project through
-- the existing append-only enforcement record, in the same transaction as
-- the flag. That record names the flags as its standing-rule issuer; no
-- moderator approves a flag before it counts.
--
-- A flag stops counting when it closes. The reporter may withdraw it. A clean
-- scan resolves only flags in its immutable request snapshot. A moderator
-- reinstatement resolves the flags it reviews. A clean fresh scan after a pause
-- that flags alone placed appends a signed vetting-service reinstatement.
-- History is never deleted or rewritten.
